# Overview
Welcome to DEV238x Front-End Web Developer Capstone.
This is the culmination of the Microsoft Professional Program for Front-End Web Development track.

# Description (Scenario)
WorldWideImporters is starting a small grocery segment to offer online shopping for their fruit and produce groceries. The website to support this segment will be constructed using the latest web technologies and frameworks in order to make the front-end portion of the site responsive and adaptive to a wide array of platforms and mobile devices.

The site will consist of a common layout with navigation, header, and footer sections to provide a common look and feel while offering a shopping experience that is easy to use and intuitive.
